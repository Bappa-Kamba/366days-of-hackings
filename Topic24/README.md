# Containerization

containerisation platforms make use of the “namespace” feature of the operating sysrem kernel, which is a feature used so that processes can access resources of the operating system without being able to interact with other processes (other running application on operating system) .

Every process running on Linux will be assigned two things:

1. A namespace
2. A process identifier (PID)
